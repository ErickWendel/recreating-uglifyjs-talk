Welcome! This repository gathers all the references, slides, and resources from my talk **"Recreating UglifyJS From Scratch: Demystifying Code Minification and Source Map Generation"**.

## üöÄ About the Talk

Unlock the secrets of code minification and source map generation! In this session, you'll:

- Explore Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and their role in code manipulation.
- Recreate a simplified version of UglifyJS from scratch.
- Learn how source maps work and how to generate them.
- Get inspired to build your own code-generation tools.
